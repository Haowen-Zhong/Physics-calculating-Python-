    "The loop is supposed to calculate the double integral. <br>\n",
    "To fill in the for loop, study what is returned by the 'gaussxwab' function and how do you use it to evaluate the integral. The easiest thing that can possibly be done is write a triple for loop. <br>\n",
    "However for loops are quite slow in python. You should be able to reduce it to a double loop by using inbuilt functions on numpy array. Take inspiration from here https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.math.html <br>\n",
    "The next way to avoid loops in python is use [broadcasting](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html) and/or use of numpy.einsum. Though you are not required to use it here, its nevertheless a handy thing to know about and this problem is one of the simplest cases where you can use it. You will not need to add any new loops inside the one given (though you may need to declare new variables), and it should be faster than both 2 and 3 for loops."
