    "\n",
    "Markov chain Monte Carlo is a general method based on drawing values of $\\theta$ from approximate distributions and then correcting those draws to better aproximate the target posterior distribution. The sampling is done sequentially, wtih the distribution of the sampled draws depending on the last value drawn - hence, the draws from a Markov chain. (p. 275, <i>Bayesian Data Analysis</i>, Andrew Gelman et al.) (Remember that a sequence $x_1, x_2, ...$ of random events is called a Markov chain if $x_{n+1}$ depends explicitly on $x_{n}$ only (and not explicitly on previous steps).) Here, we consider six selected cosmologial parameters: [$H_0, \\Omega_b h^2, \\Omega_c h^2, n_s, A_s, \\tau$], so the \"chain\" in this case is a random walk through the parameter space.\n",

    "In this homework, we use a compilation of supernovae data to show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, and hence it contains dark energy. This is the Nobel prize winning research in 2011 (https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/), and Saul Perlmutter, a professor of physics at Berkeley, shared a prize in 2011 for this discovery.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\"The expansion history of the universe can be determined quite easily, using as a “standard candle” any distinguishable class of astronomical objects of known intrinsic brightness that can be identified over a wide distance range. As the light from such beacons travels to Earth through an expanding universe, the cosmic expansion stretches not only the distances between galaxy clusters, but also the very wavelengths of the photons en route. By the time the light reaches us, the spectral wavelength $\\lambda$ has thus been redshifted by precisely the same incremental factor $z = \\Delta \\lambda/\\lambda$ by which the cosmos has been stretched in the time interval since the light left its source. The recorded redshift and brightness of each such object thus provide a measurement of the total integrated expansion of the universe since the time the light was emitted. A collection of such measurements, over a sufficient range of distances, would yield an entire historical record of the universe’s expansion.\" (Saul Perlmutter, http://supernova.lbl.gov/PhysicsTodayArticle.pdf).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Supernovae emerge as extremely promising candidates for measuring the cosmic expansion. Type I Supernovae arises from the collapse of white dwarf stars when the Chandrasekhar limit is reached. Such nuclear chain reaction occurs in the same way and at the same mass, the brightness of these supernovae are always the same. The relationship between the apparent brightness and distance of supernovae depend on the contents and curvature of the universe.\n",

    "We can infer the \"luminosity distance\" $D_L$ from measuring the inferred brightness of a supernova of luminosity $L$. Assuming a naive Euclidean approach, if the supernova is observed to have flux $F$, then the area over which the flux is distributed is a sphere radius $D_L$, and hence <br><br>\n",

Note that $a_0 = 1, z_0 = 0$.), and $\\chi$ is the comoving distance, the distance between two objects as would be measured instantaneously today. For a photon, $cdt = a(t)d\\chi$, so $\\chi(t) = c\\int_t^{t_0} \\frac{dt'}{a(t')}$. We can write this in terms of a Hubble factor ($H(t) = \\frac{1}{a}\\frac{da}{dt}$), which tells you the expansion rate: $\\chi(a) = c\\int_a^1 \\frac{da'}{a'^2H(a')} = c\\int_0^z \\frac{dz'}{H(z')}$.

If $\\Omega_0 < 1$, the universe will continue to expand forever. If $\\Omega_0 > 1$, the expansion will stop eventually and the universe will start to recollapse. If $\\Omega_0 = 1$, then the universe is flat and contains enough matter to halt the expansion but not enough to recollapse it. So it will continue expanding, but gradually slowing down all the time, finally running out of steam only in the infinite future.
